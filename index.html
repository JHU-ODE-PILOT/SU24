        <b>PILOT Information:</b>
        <ul>
            <li>PILOT is a loose acronym for peer-led-team learning. In the PILOT program, students are organized into study teams of six to ten members who meet weekly to work problems together. A trained student leader acts as captain and facilitates the meetings. PILOT aims to help students make a smooth transition to college life both academically and socially. More importantly, PILOT aims to actively teach and demonstrate how collaborative learning uses contributions from individuals to benefit a group.</li>
            <li>For more information about PILOT at Hopkins, please visit its <a href="https://academicsupport.jhu.edu/pilot/" target="_blank">webpage</a>.</li>
            <li>Summer PILOT works as an extra office hour.</li>

        <b>Important Documents:</b>
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://livejohnshopkins.sharepoint.com/sites/mathland/ODE_PILOT/SitePages/S24.aspx" target="_blank">Conpetual Problem Set</a>:<br>
            A specially designed extra problem set is updated for students who are interested in mathematical proof and fun questions underlying the base of ODEs. The extra problem set contains approximately 4 problems for each week. This set is completely voluntary and its contents are mostly outside the scope of this class (conventionally). <br>
            Feel free to attempt questions from this document if you finish the problem set earlier and I am happy to discuss about it.</li>
            <li><a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~brown/courses/f18/Syllabus302.html" target="_blank">Theorem Booklet</a>: <br> This document includes various definitions, theorems, and formulas about ODE that I compiled during F22 and adjusted up until Summer 24. The document should include the most information needed for the scope of this class.</li>
            <li><a href="https://math.jhu.edu/~lindblad/302/302.html" target="_blank">Laplace Table</a>: <br> This document includes a table of Laplace transformation that most instructors would provide during their assessments. This document can be a helpful tool before your instructor has provided you with their version.</li>
            <li><a href="contents/Activities-Slides.pdf" target="_blank">Activity Slide</a>: <br> Here is a set of slides deck that we could be playing with when we need some engagements. Feel free to play with some of it in advance.</li>
